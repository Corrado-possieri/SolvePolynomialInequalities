Numerical Packages to Solve Systems of Polynomial Inequalities

In this repositoy there are two packages that allow to solve systems of polynomial inequalities.

1. The package DisSolve.m2 is a Macaualy2 package to solve numerically systems of polynomial inequalities. Please note that at line 35 of such a package you need to insert the local path to the package NumericSolutions.m2 that can be downloaded from the following link:
https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2/blob/master/M2/Macaulay2/packages/NumericSolutions.m2

2. The package SolveInequalities is a Mathematica package that allows to find the solutions to a symbolic system of polynomial inequalities.
